# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for a Flutter application with Firebase integration. The application will include core features like user authentication, a social feed, real-time chat, and a new generative AI-powered chat feature.

## Features

### Implemented Features

*   **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out using Firebase Authentication.
*   **Social Feed:** Users can create and view posts in a real-time feed.
*   **Real-time Chat:** Users can chat with each other in real-time.
*   **Theming:** The application supports both light and dark themes.
*   **Notifications:** Users receive push notifications for new messages.
*   **App Check:** The application uses Firebase App Check to protect against abuse.
*   **Generative AI Chat:** Users can chat with a generative AI model.

### Current Plan: Verify Generative AI Chat

This plan outlines the final steps to verify the implementation of the generative AI chat feature.

**Steps:**

1.  **Verify Implementation:** Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter run` to verify that the new implementation is free of errors and that the AI chat feature is working as expected.
