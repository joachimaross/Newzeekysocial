This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for a Flutter application with Firebase integration. The application includes core features like user authentication, a social feed, real-time chat, generative AI-powered chat, and full iOS/Android cross-platform support.

## Features

### Implemented Features

*   **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out using Firebase Authentication.
*   **Social Feed:** Users can create and view posts in a real-time feed.
*   **Real-time Chat:** Users can chat with each other in real-time.
*   **Theming:** The application supports both light and dark themes.
*   **Notifications:** Users receive push notifications for new messages.
*   **App Check:** The application uses Firebase App Check to protect against abuse.
*   **Generative AI Chat:** Users can chat with a generative AI model.
*   **iOS Support:** Full iOS platform support with Firebase integration.

### iOS Firebase Integration - COMPLETED

#### Implementation Summary:

✅ **Podfile Configuration**: Created comprehensive Podfile with all required Firebase iOS SDK dependencies:
- Firebase/Core for app initialization
- Firebase/Auth for authentication 
- Firebase/Firestore for database operations
- Firebase/Storage for file uploads
- Firebase/Messaging for push notifications  
- Firebase/AppCheck for security

✅ **AppDelegate Setup**: Updated AppDelegate.swift with proper Firebase initialization:
- Added Firebase import
- FirebaseApp.configure() call in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
- Plugin registration maintained

✅ **Plugin Registration**: Created GeneratedPluginRegistrant.swift with all Firebase plugins:
- Cloud Firestore plugin registration
- Firebase Auth plugin registration  
- Firebase Core plugin registration
- Firebase Messaging plugin registration
- Firebase Storage plugin registration
- Firebase App Check plugin registration
- Local notifications and image picker plugins

✅ **Project Configuration**: Updated iOS project settings:
- Bundle identifier aligned with Firebase configuration (com.example.myap)
- App display name updated to "Zeeky Social"
- Added camera and photo library permissions
- Minimum iOS deployment target set to 12.0+

✅ **Firebase App Check**: Configured iOS-specific App Check provider:

- Firebase dependencies confirmation  
- Plugin registration validation
- Bundle identifier alignment check
- App Check configuration verification

#### Build Process:
1. Install CocoaPods dependencies: `cd ios && pod install`
2. Open in Xcode: `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`  
3. Build for iOS: `flutter build ios`
4. Run on device/simulator: `flutter run -d ios`

#### Production Readiness:
- Firebase App Check configured with DeviceCheck API for iOS security
- Proper permission handling for camera and photo library access
- Bundle identifier configuration compatible with App Store distribution
- Minimum iOS 12.0 support for broad device compatibility
