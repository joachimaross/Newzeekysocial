# Zeeky Social

**Creator: Joa’Chima Ross**

Zeeky Social is a next-generation AI-powered social and messaging platform that unites communication, creativity, and community into one seamless ecosystem. It blends the best of Apple iMessage, Google Messages, and modern social networks, then reimagines them with AI at the core.

At the heart of the platform is Zeeky—an intelligent AI assistant who is more than a chatbot: he’s a partner, a creator, and a collaborator.

This is not just another app. Zeeky Social is the blueprint for the future of digital interaction.
